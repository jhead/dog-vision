# **App Name**: DogVision

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Photo upload and display for comparison
- Dog Vision Transformation: Convert and display images to show how dogs see the world (equivalent to red-green color blindness).
- Image Display: Side-by-side image comparison
- Image Slider: Slider to switch between human vision and dog vision images.
- Responsiveness: Responsive layout and design for mobile/desktop

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5D9CEC), chosen to suggest visual perception and evoke the technological aspect of the application while being friendly for our canine theme.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#D6E6F2), desaturated and light to keep the focus on the images.
- Accent color: A slightly darker, more saturated blue (#4A89DC) will create good contrast with the light background and still sit harmoniously next to the primary color. 
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Clean and simple layout for easy comparison and usage
